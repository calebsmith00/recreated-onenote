# Information

This is a recreation of [my OneNote project](https://github.com/minifiedcode/onenote). This recreation was put in place simply because there was too much confusion when navigating between local MSGraph requests as well as my own API's requests.

# How To Use

This project uses [yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/). To install dependencies, run `yarn` in the CLI; this might take a few minutes. After installing dependencies, run the development server by typing `npm run dev` in the CLI. Navigate to [your local network](https://localhost:3000).
